extraction/vaanidoc_pipeline/coverage.py

Dynamic CBC / panel coverage checking.

CHANGE FROM ORIGINAL
--------------------
The original module hard-coded 14 CBC markers and always
reported coverage against that fixed set.

This version is DYNAMIC:
  - It groups detected tests by panel (CBC, LFT, KFT, etc.)
    using the test_registry.
  - It reports per-panel coverage so a thyroid report gets a
    "THYROID" coverage block, not a "CBC" block showing 0/14.
  - The top-level `status` field is computed across ALL
    panels that have at least one test detected.
  - Backward compatibility: the old flat fields
    (detected_markers, missing_markers, duplicate_markers,
    unknown_markers, coverage_percent) are still present and
    describe the PRIMARY panel (the one with most detections).
