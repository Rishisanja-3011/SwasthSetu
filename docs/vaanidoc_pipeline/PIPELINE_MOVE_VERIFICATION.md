# Pipeline Organization Verification

**Date:** 2026-10-03  
**Task:** Safe pipeline organization (documentation-only approach)

---

## Test Counts

| Stage | Tests | Failures |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Baseline (pre-organization) | **184** | 0 |
| After organization | **184** | 0 |
| Delta | 0 | 0 |

**No regressions.**

## Sample PDF Results — Before vs After

### sample.pdf

| Field | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| tests | 14 | **14** ✅ |
| can_analyze | True | **True** ✅ |
| status | VALID | **VALID** ✅ |
| review_required | False | **False** ✅ |
| publish_blocking_reasons | `[]` | **`[]`** ✅ |
| template_explanations | 14 | **14** ✅ |
| rdw status | HIGH | **HIGH** ✅ |
| neutrophils status | HIGH | **HIGH** ✅ |
| any needs_review=True | False | **False** ✅ |

### sample2.pdf

| Field | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| tests | 0 | **0** ✅ |
| can_analyze | False | **False** ✅ |
| status | UNSAFE_TO_ANALYZE | **UNSAFE_TO_ANALYZE** ✅ |
| review_required | False | **False** ✅ |
| publish_blocking_reasons | `['Report processing blocked: UNSAFE_TO_ANALYZE']` | **same** ✅ |
| template_explanation | `[]` | **`[]`** ✅ |

**Pipeline behavior: UNCHANGED.**

## Files Created During Organization

| File | Type | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `docs/vaanidoc_pipeline/PIPELINE_FOLDER_MOVE_PLAN.md` | Doc | Per-file SAFE/SHARED/DO NOT MOVE classification |
| `docs/vaanidoc_pipeline/PIPELINE_FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md` | Doc | Runtime flow, file map, import boundaries, test commands |
| `extraction/README.md` | Doc | In-package guide — VaaniDoc role of every file |

---

## Files Moved

**None.** Physical file structure left unchanged.

---

## Files Intentionally Left In Place

All 9 `extraction/` modules remain at `extraction/*.py`:

| Module | Reason Not Moved |
|--------|-----------------|
| `pipeline.py` | Shared — `app.py`, `ui_uploads.py`, `vision/extractor.py` |
| `parser.py` | Shared — `vision/layout_parser.py` imports `TEST_ALIASES` |
| `validator.py` | Shared — `app.py` imports `apply_patient_corrections`, `validate_report` |
| `plausibility.py` | Shared — `app.py`, `main.py` |
| `patient_parser.py` | Shared — `main.py` |
| `coverage.py` | Shared — `main.py` |
| `text_cleaner.py` | Shared — `main.py` |
| `pdf_reader.py` | Shared — `main.py` |
| `explainer.py` | VaaniDoc-specific — kept alongside `pipeline.py` |

---

## Compatibility Wrappers

**None created.** No files were moved, so no wrappers were needed.

---

## What Changed

- `extraction/vaanidoc_pipeline/` directory: **created then immediately deleted** (the analysis showed it was not needed)
- 3 documentation files created in `docs/vaanidoc_pipeline/`
- `extraction/README.md` created

---

## Confirmation

✅ No pipeline behavior changed  
✅ No source code deleted  
✅ No duplicate modules created  
✅ No existing import paths broken  
✅ `app.py`, `ui_uploads.py`, `main.py`, `vision/`, tests all unmodified  
✅ `knowledge_engine/`, `medical_reference/`, `interpretation/` untouched  
✅ 184 tests pass — no regressions
