# Audit Copies — Read Only

**IMPORTANT:**  
These are COPIES of original source files created during the VaaniDoc 2.0 pipeline audit (2026-10-03).

- The **original files remain unchanged** in their original locations.
- These copies are **NOT imported or executed** by the application.
- Do **not** modify these copies and expect changes to take effect in the app.
- Do **not** add these to any Python import path.

## Purpose

These copies were created to:
1. Provide a snapshot of the active pipeline at audit time
2. Support cross-referencing without navigating the full source tree
3. Serve as a reference if files are later refactored in the next implementation chunk
